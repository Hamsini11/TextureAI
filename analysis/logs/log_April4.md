## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
April 4 2025 


### Number of hours: 
10 hours 

### Rose:
I worked on basic object detection inside a room using YOLOv8. It was great to see the model detect objects like chairs and tables pretty accurately. Setting it up and seeing results quickly felt rewarding.

### Bud: 
Next, I’m planning to work on adding textures based on object segments, not just the whole object. For this, I’ll use ControlNet with Stable Diffusion to apply textures more accurately. I’m excited to see how this improves the quality and detail in the results. 

### Thorn: 
The main challenge was that YOLOv8 only detects whole objects using boxes, not detailed parts. So when I applied textures, they covered the entire object rather than specific parts, which didn’t look very realistic. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
